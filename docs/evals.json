        "model_response": "To solve $x^2 + 5x + 6 = 0$, we can do one of two things, we can either factorise or use the quadratic formula!\n\nAs shown in the revision video, to factorise, we are looking for two numbers that multiply to make **6** and add to make **5**.\n\nThose numbers are $2$ and $3$. So as shown in the video we can write those numbers in the brackets next to the x's, and set that equal to 0:\n$$(x + 2)(x + 3) = 0$$\n\nNow, for this to equal zero, either bracket must be zero (think about it! We have two things multiplying together to get zero, that can only happen if one of them is zero!). Therefore, our solutions are:\n$$x = -2 \\text{ or } x = -3$$\n\nDoes that make sense?"
