## The Problem  
GCSE students often watch revision videos but lack immediate feedback when they get stuck on specific questions. Private tutors are expensive (£40/hr+), leaving many students with "cold start" problems during revision.

## The Solution
Mappth is a Flutter based mobile app combining 100+ bespoke video tutorials, along with Richard, a context-aware AI Agent.
* **Video Content and questions:** Proprietary revision videos and questions.
* **AI Agent (Richard):** An LLM based tutor that answers student queries and generates infinite exam style questions on demand.

## Tech stack
* **Frontend:** FlutterFlow (Low code)
* **AI backend:** OpenAI API
* **Database:** Firebase

## Documentation
* [PRD](docs/PRD.md) - *Detailed feature specs and success metrics.*
* [Ethics](docs/Ethics.md) - *How I prevent Richard from hallucinating math answers.*

## Performance (Coming Soon)
* Target metric: 30% conversion from video view -> AI chat interaction.
